# MacSGP: Mapping Cell-Type-Specific Spatial Gene Programs Uncovers Tissue Architecture and Microenvironment Organization

## Introduction

`MacSGP` is a scalable statistical and computational approach for MApping Cell-type-specific SGPs in spatial transcriptomic (ST) data.

## Real data analysis

The code for reproducing the real data analysis results presented in our paper are available on the tutorial website
(<https://macsgp-tutorial.readthedocs.io/>).
